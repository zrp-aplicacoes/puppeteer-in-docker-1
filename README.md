# Puppeteer in Docker - Alpine

A minimal Node Alpine + Puppeteer base Docker image for your scrapping needs and other shenanigans.

## Support

It currently uses Puppeteer version `1.17.0` and Chromium version `76.0.3809.87` since the second is the [latest Chromium package supported by Alpine](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/community/x86_64/chromium) as this README writing.

Updates as new Chromium packages rolls out for Alpine =)
